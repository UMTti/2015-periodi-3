# JPEG-like compressing algorithm 

JPEG based image compression written in Java. Actually the same parts as in JPEG and now ready are:

1. Discrete cosine transformation
2. Quantization

Huffman coding is done with constructing a trie, not with statistical way as JPEG does. The next task is to implement terminal user interface for compress() and show() -functions in Jpeg.java .

Source code is in jpeg/src folder.
